Found a codepen where you can isolate the vocals from the track through bandpress filter.
It doesn't work perfectly, but maybe we can find use for it if we want to isolate the vocals programmatically. 

In order for it to work, make sure you start with live-server or you will have cross-origin errors. 
If you want to try different music to experiment go to line 72 and insert the relative path of your mp3 location.
